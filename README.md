              Editor Version: 1.0 Trial

    This is a simple text editor by Vedant Gune
    created for practising Tkinter & Python3, 
    This is free and open source so please, 
    add your ideas and help me to develop it more and more!
    
    I got help from codewithharry's Youtube videos
    and documentations from,
    Python Tkinter, geeksforgeeks and stackoverflow!


Basically, This is a very old project and after learning Git, I thought I should upload my code to GitHub. Hence I am uploading my code here! Please ignore some of my basic mistakes, as I am just a beginner I totally understand I haven't followed basic PEP8 rules as my code contains repeatation, bad formatting and lot more mistakes

Thanks,
Vedant Gune
